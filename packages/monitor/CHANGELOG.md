# Changelog â @zerotal/monitor

All notable changes to this package are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this package
follows the Zerotal monorepo's unified versioning.

**Maturity: `experimental`**

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] — 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Re-released from a rebuilt repository so the build provenance resolves. The
  1.0.2 attestation names a repository that was renamed away, which leaves the
  signature valid but the trace back to source dangling. No code changed.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Reported framework version was stale again; it now matches the release.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Reported framework version was pinned at the pre-release `1.1.0` in the health
  report and the system-meta fallback, so a monitored app advertised a version
  that was never published.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-05

_First public release._

### Notes

- Conforms to the Zerotal package conventions (provider in `src/provider/`, PascalCase config factory, `ZerotalError`-based errors, test coverage).
